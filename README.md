# cppdoc 
cppdoc is a C++ documentation generator inspired by `rustdoc`

## Features
- `rustdoc`-like documentation comments, rendered using markdown
- Documentation tests using codeblocks
- Extra documentation pages in markdown
- mermaid.js graphs
- Flexible styling options, with user-supplied stylesheets (see default themes in `example/`)
- libclang-based parser with support for records, enums, functions and namespaces
- Fair performance, with generation usually being faster than clang-backed Doxygen

## Preview
Screenshot soon :tm:
